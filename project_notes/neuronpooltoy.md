closeness to center - possibly


sensors - 
sensors are 1.5 pipes wide and divide field evenly
can limit number of sensors - can cover the playfield with sensors and can tweak
distance to top / bottom
distance to center of gap
or course height from ceiling and floor
position
velocity
can have invisible sensors behind player that can result as memory - possibly

can have square sensors - pipe - one, no pipe 0 

will make a grid of course sensors - if the pipe is 80 pixels will make the sensors half. if there at all on, etc. will have less resolution - will train to have more intuition. humans can convert a problem from digital to an anolog problem.
